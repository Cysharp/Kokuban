# üñç Kokuban
Kokuban simplifies styling strings in the terminal for .NET applications. (Kokuban is "blackboard" in Japanese.)

![](docs/assets/Screen-01.png)

Kokuban is based on JavaScript library [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) for many of its concepts and some of its code.

## Features
- Expressive API
- Auto detects color support
- Auto enables escape sequence support on Windows 10 20H1 or later
- 256 (8-bit) / TrueColor (24-bit) colors support

## Requirements

- .NET Standard 2.0 or higher

## Install
```
dotnet package add Kokuban
```

## Usage

```csharp
using Kokuban;

// Use `+` operator.
Console.WriteLine(Chalk.Red + "Hello");
Console.WriteLine(Chalk.Red + ("Hello " + (Chalk.Underline.BgBlue + "World")) + "!");

// Use indexer.
Console.WriteLine(Chalk.Red.Underline["Hello"]);
Console.WriteLine(Chalk.Red.Underline["Hello " + Chalk.Underline.BgBlue["World"]]);

// Use `ToStyledString` extension method.
Console.WriteLine("Foo Bar Baz".ToStyledString(Chalk.White.Blue));

// Use `Render` method.
Console.WriteLine(Chalk.Rgb(255, 128, 128).Render("Hello Konnichiwa!"));
```
### Nested styles
If you nest styled strings, the styles will be automatically stacked.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(
    Chalk.Bold.Gray.BgYellow[
        "Ôºº" + 
        Chalk.White.BgRed["Hello"] +
        " " +
        Chalk.White.BgBlue["„Ç≥„É≥„Éã„ÉÅ„Éè"] +
        "!!Ôºè"
    ]
);
// or
Console.WriteLine(
    Chalk.Bold.Gray.BgYellow + (
        "Ôºº" + (Chalk.White.BgRed + "Hello") + " " + (Chalk.White.BgBlue + "„Ç≥„É≥„Éã„ÉÅ„Éè") + "!!Ôºè"
    )
);

```

## API
### `Chalk.<style>{.<style>...}[string]`

```csharp
Chalk.Red.Underline["Hello"] // => "Hello" (Red + Underlined)
```

### `Kokuban.Chalk` class
You can customize the behavior by explicitly instancing the Chalk class and use it.

```csharp
var chalk = new Chalk(new KokubanOptions
{
    // The output will be forced to plain text, whether the terminal supports colors or not.
    Mode = KokubanColorMode.None,
});

Console.WriteLine(chalk.Red.Underline["Hello"]); // => "Hello" without escape sequences.
```

## 256 colors (8-bit) and TrueColor (24-bit) support
Kokuban also supports 256 colors (8-bit) and TrueColors (24-bit) on supported terminals, same as [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk#256-and-truecolor-color-support).

The automatic detection of support states and color downsampling are derived from Chalk.

Kokuban supports ANSI 256-palette index (`Ansi256` method) and RGB format (`Rgb` method). However, Hex format (e.g. `#AABBCC`) is not yet supported.
